##Note - Despite that the script works, it is not finished yet and is still in an experimental state.

#Title description
##Unofficial Qubes Maintenance Updater (uQMU).

#>>>>WARNING!<<<<
##Please read the script carefully, do not run if you do not know what it does.
##Be sure you edit it correctly to your own needs.

#Disclaimer:
##Coding is not my profession, nor do I have deep insight into advanced scripting.
##Feel free to critesize and suggest constructive improvements.

#Quick purpose overview:
##This script performs auto-updates of dom0 and every default template. The script is
##highly customizeable, warning message/Quick-Backup/repositories, can be adjusted or
##disabled. It also includes a quick optional qvm-backup reminder/starter. If you use
##backup profiles instead of manually configuring which VMs to include or exclude in
##the qvm-backup, then all you need to do is to adjust the qvm-backup command below,
##similar to how you normally would execute the command in dom0 terminal.

#Important notes
##1) Be sure you have enough free RAM to run the largest RAM intensive template, one at a time.
##2) The script will halt if it is interupted, such as not enoguh RAM.
##3) VM's will shutdown automatically if no updates, or after succesfull update install.
##4) You may include the -y option to auto-accept updates in some VMs, be careful though.
##5) You can disable the Quick Backup, however if you use it then remember to configure it.
##6) Add or remove '#Í„' in front of the command instructions to disable/enable commands.
##7) Reminder: Always consider a full system reboot if you accepted dom0 updates.
##8) Reminder: Always consider restarting AppVMs if you accepted template updates.
##9) The purpose of --check-only & --refresh is to only download what is needed, metadata.
#10) Should metata determine available updates, it will then still offer to update like normal.
#11) The reduction of overhead downloads, ethically allows for more frequent update checks.
#12) Its essential to keep dom0/templates in sync between repositories & cache expirations.
#13) This script essentially does just that, systematically removing mistakes, making it easier.
#14) Repositories must be in sync, such as between stable & current-testing for dom0/tempaltes.
#15) Script is for normal use, security-testing & unstable-testing repositories are not included.
#16) Only use current-testing if you know what you are getting yourself into, it is untested.
#17) This script release version is only tested on Qubes 4.0.

#Script weaknesses
##1) Script failing halfway through, without being detected (it can fail silently, i.e if out of
##   RAM. However it will on the other hand post a message if it succesfully makes it through.
##2) Mis-configuration of the script, for example mixing current-testing with stable repositories.
##3) Other potential issues that were not predicted.

#Warning message
##This warning meesage can be disabled with a #. It includes essential warning for new users
##not aware of the pitfalls of scripts. Its highly recommended that new users study how the
##script works, it's not very complicated, but also not straight simple either.

#Quick Backup Redundancy
##The purpose here is to serve as a reminder to backup before performing updates, which always
##carries a risk of making the system unbootable. This serves as a popup message, which you
##can decline to continue without starting qvm-backup, or click yes to perform your qvm-backup.
##Keep in mind you need to adjust it below to your own customized qvm-backup. The default will
##only exclude system dom0 & default templates. However a proper path/src-VM is still required.
##Remember to put the backup externally, so that you can access it if the system does not boot.
