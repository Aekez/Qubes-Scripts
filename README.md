# Qubes-Scripts
Scripts to make every day tasks a little bit easier on Qubes OS.
This is a short-list of my Qubes scripts, which is not a larger project that attained a repository on its own.

## Scripts
### Automated dom0 to AppVM Screenshotting, with (f/w/r)
- Fullscreen (f), window (w), and region (r), allowing for flexibile keybinding, and automatically send the screenshot into a predetermined desired AppVM.

### unofficial Qubes Maintenance Updater (uQMU)
- This script is not ready to be shared, however, it is also reaching towards a finished state. It will however need some small fixes, as well as a proper review.


### Qubes full-screen any window 
- This allows for a more ideal and quick keybind, rather than having to use alt+space+f or right clicking the panels. Furthermore it can be bound to other devices than a keyboard, i.e. to a numpad for QubesTV.
